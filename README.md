## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I practice the basics of HTML and CSS, remember the core concepts of each and polish a result as close as posible to the design. The one I liked the most was CSS Grid, easy to implement and really powerful.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue practicing CSS Grid, never used CSS Grid before and I love it, i'ts easier to make responsive websites with it, so i'd like to master it.

### Useful resources

- [Gradient Generator](https://cssgradient.io/) - This help me to generate the gradiants in an easier way.
